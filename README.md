# Trading Journal 📝

A personal **Trading Journal & Performance Analysis System** built with Django and PostgreSQL.  
Instead of predicting markets, it helps traders **understand their decisions, emotions, and patterns** to improve performance over time.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

- Record trades with **strategy, entry/exit, and PnL**  
- Track **emotions and rule adherence**  
- Analyze patterns to see **why trades succeed or fail**  
- Reflect on performance, not rely on tips or signals

> Think of it as a “fitness tracker for your trading mindset.”

---

## 💻 Features

- User authentication (signup/login)  
- Create, edit, delete trades  
- Tag trades with **strategy & emotion**  
- Track **rule adherence**  
- Analytics: PnL over time, win rate by strategy, behavior patterns  
- Optional: monthly self-review, discipline scoring, CSV export

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Django  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Frontend:** Django templates  
- **Analytics:** Python (pandas)

🎯 Why It Stands Out

Focuses on behavioral analytics, not market tips

Helps traders reflect and improve discipline

Great portfolio project: Django + database + analytics

⚠️ Disclaimer

This app does not provide trading advice. It is purely for self-reflection and learning.
